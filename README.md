# Sidequest

Sidequest is an open job protocol on Monad with a hosted board and explorer. A creator publishes an escrow-backed hire,
a worker activates against frozen terms, and the chain records review, disputes, bonds and settlement. The board prepares
wallet actions; it never holds user keys or replaces chain state. V1 is the only supported protocol.

## Stages

| Stage   | Origin                                                   | Network                              | Deployment                                             |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`   | [dev.sidequest.exchange](https://dev.sidequest.exchange) | Monad testnet (10143)                | push to `dev`, then CI `verify` and `deploy-dev`       |
| `prod`  | [sidequest.exchange](https://sidequest.exchange)         | Monad testnet until the mainnet gate | manual promotion of an accepted SHA; Kris must approve |
| `local` | localhost                                                | local Alchemy/Workerd                | `bun run dev`                                          |

The stage profile in `infra/<stage>.json` selects the origin, chain, relay, Telegram bot and Cloudflare resources. The
single testnet contract pair is `deployment.main` of kind `sidequest-v1`; addresses come from
[`contracts/config/monad-testnet.json`](contracts/config/monad-testnet.json). Mainnet is a future, separately approved
stage change.

Runtime classes and import edges are declared in [tools/graph.ts](tools/graph.ts). Read the matching workspace
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before editing a workspace.

## Work and promotion

Work on `dev`; there is no `main`. A push to `dev` runs CI verification and the guarded dev deploy. Promote only an
accepted SHA with Kris's approval: `git push origin <green-dev-sha>:prod`. Never run a prod release or push `prod`
without that approval. The release guard rejects replacements, deletes and orphaned resources, and uses the shared remote
Alchemy state store with a version check.

## Daily commands

```bash
bun install
bun run check:files <owned paths>
bun run agents:check
bun run graph
bun run typecheck
bun run lint:gate
bunx turbo run test --filter <workspace>
bun run deploy:dev
bun run plan dev
bun run smoke dev
```

Use `heavy` for a command that may take over a minute. Exit 75 means the shared box is busy; retry after it clears. Never
pipe `heavy`. Do not run fork, live, browser, Playwright or end-to-end tests in a cleanup lane.

## Secrets

Local stage values are in mode-600 `~/.config/sidequest/dev.env` and `~/.config/sidequest/prod.env`; local flow and test
keys belong in `.env.local`; CI uses the GitHub `dev` and `prod` environments. Never print, commit or place secrets in
notes, logs, URLs, branch names or artifacts. Release commands disable Bun's automatic env-file loading.
