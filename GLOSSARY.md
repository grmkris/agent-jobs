# Glossary

Terms used in Sidequest code, docs and agent instructions. Links point to the defining source; use the preferred term in
new code and prose.

## Products and code

- **Sidequest** — the v1 Monad protocol and hosted board in this repository. See [README](README.md). _Avoid: Hireling, agent-jobs._
- **Explore** — the browser marketplace and explorer at the stage origin. See [apps/explore](apps/explore/AGENTS.md). _Avoid: frontend, demo app._
- **Board** — the hosted API, MCP service and persistence layer that prepares actions and indexes listings. See [packages/board](packages/board/AGENTS.md). _Avoid: escrow, wallet, settlement authority._
- **Hosted agent** — an operator-owned managed agent connected through hosted MCP, with a registered wallet and bounded routine signing authority. See [ADR-0013](docs/adr/0013-agent-authority.md). _Avoid: agent account, signer._
- **Crew** — retired development tooling; it is not a Sidequest product or protocol actor. See the [legacy tag](https://github.com/grmkris/sidequest/tree/legacy-final). _Avoid: hosted agent._
- **SDK** — the typed client and v1 flow helpers in [`packages/sdk`](packages/sdk/AGENTS.md). _Avoid: protocol implementation._
- **Workspace** — a node declared in [`tools/graph.ts`](tools/graph.ts), under `apps/`, `packages/`, `contracts/` or `tools/`. _Avoid: app (when referring to every node)._

## Protocol

- **Hire** — a v1 on-chain job with a fixed reward and frozen offer terms. See [ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-sidequest-v1.md). _Avoid: contest, pool, pledge, crowdfund._
- **Quote request** — an off-chain request for workers to propose terms before selection. See [ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-sidequest-v1.md). _Avoid: bid (unless the API field says bid)._
- **Selection** — the creator-signed choice of a worker and frozen listing terms. See [ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-sidequest-v1.md). _Avoid: award._
- **Activation** — the worker action that confirms the frozen listing, reserves its bond and funds the core. See [protocol law](docs/protocol.md). _Avoid: acceptance._
- **Bond** — stake reserved for a live hire and released or slashed at settlement. See [ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-sidequest-v1.md). _Avoid: pledge, deposit (unless describing an ERC-20 transfer)._
- **Stake** — SIDE v2 held in `StakeVault`, including backing and reservations. See [ADR-0014](docs/adr/0014-delegated-stake.md). _Avoid: SIDE v1, token balance._
- **Approver** — the per-offer address that judges delivery against frozen criteria. See [protocol law](docs/protocol.md). _Avoid: evaluator (the contract)._
- **Arbitrator** — the named address that rules a disputed outcome before its cutoff. See [protocol law](docs/protocol.md). _Avoid: judge, classifier._
- **Ruling** — an arbitrator's signed decision for a named hire and nonce. See [ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-sidequest-v1.md). _Avoid: approval._
- **Top-up** — an additional reward-token contribution while a hire is active. See [protocol law](docs/protocol.md). _Avoid: funding (when referring to a top-up alone)._
- **Execution budget** — an optional, non-escrowed ERC-7710 delegation for bounded worker costs. See [ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-budget-delegation.md). _Avoid: reward, allowance._
- **Sponsorship** — a separate zero-value delegation authorizing relay gas for listed methods. See [sponsorship](docs/sponsorship.md). _Avoid: execution budget, gasless._
- **Relay** — the stage-specific account that broadcasts an authorized sponsored action. See [stages](docs/stages.md). _Avoid: board wallet, user wallet._
- **Attester** — the configured service that records external evidence claims; its signature does not prove truth. See [protocol law](docs/protocol.md). _Avoid: approver, arbitrator._
- **Mining epoch** — a completed time interval whose priced treasury fees can fund a Merkle root and stake claims. See [mining claims](docs/mining-claims.md). _Avoid: yield, earnings promise._
- **Holding** — the ERC-8183 client that escrows a hire's reward and pays or records `owed`. See [ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-sidequest-v1.md). _Avoid: board escrow._
- **Evaluator** — the v1 contract that records outcomes and invokes the core's terminal calls. See [ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-sidequest-v1.md). _Avoid: classifier, approver._
- **Owed** — a recorded payout that a refusing token or recipient deferred for later withdrawal. See [protocol law](docs/protocol.md). _Avoid: failed settlement, refund._

## Stages and deploys

- **Stage** — a named deployment profile (`local`, `dev` or `prod`) selecting origin, network, relay, bot and resources. See [stages](docs/stages.md). _Avoid: environment (when naming a deployment)._
- **Dev** — the Monad testnet stage at `dev.sidequest.exchange`. See [stages](docs/stages.md). _Avoid: staging (the retired release system)._
- **Prod** — the public stage at `sidequest.exchange`, currently still on Monad testnet. See [stages](docs/stages.md). _Avoid: mainnet._
- **Release guard** — the CI check that refuses destructive, replacement, orphan and unexpected create plans. See [deploy](docs/deploy.md). _Avoid: deploy preview._
- **Remote state store** — the shared Alchemy state service used by dev and prod with a version guard. See [deploy](docs/deploy.md). _Avoid: local `.alchemy` state._
- **First deploy** — a release whose remote state and Cloudflare census prove that named resources do not exist yet. See [deploy](docs/deploy.md). _Avoid: recreate._
- **Adopt move** — the one-time operation that moves an existing named resource into remote state after a deferred adoption plan. See [deploy](docs/deploy.md). _Avoid: create._
- **Mainnet gate** — the Kris-approved A01–A08 and launch evidence required before switching prod to chain 143. See [mainnet runbook](docs/mainnet-runbook.md). _Avoid: automatic promotion._

## Tests and gates

- **Test floor** — the current passing test count for a workspace, recorded in its `AGENTS.md`. See [testing commands](README.md#daily-commands). _Avoid: coverage percentage._
- **`check:files`** — the scoped format, lint, typecheck, graph and agent checks for named paths. See [scripts/check-files.ts](scripts/check-files.ts). _Avoid: full check._
- **`agents:check`** — the instruction-file and link consistency gate. See [tools/agents-check.ts](tools/agents-check.ts). _Avoid: docs lint._
- **`heavy`** — the shared-capacity wrapper for expensive commands on the shared box; exit 75 means contention. See [README](README.md#daily-commands). _Avoid: failed test._
- **Live-verified** — a claim backed by a dated receipt in [reality-check](docs/reality-check.md). _Avoid: fork-tested, source-reviewed._
- **Fork rehearsal** — a local test against a forked chain state. See [mainnet runbook](docs/mainnet-runbook.md). _Avoid: deployment, live acceptance._
