# ADR-0011: Sidequest v1 contracts

Date: 2026-10-02. Status: **implemented, unit-tested, fork-rehearsed on Monad testnet and mainnet; audited — C9 signed
off 2 Oct (`review/contracts-C9-signoff.md`, at 4dfc039); not deployed** (`~/code/sidequest.wt/briefs/plan.md`).
Findings and resolutions are in "C9 audit" below. The sign-off is a source review, not deployment authorization. Decided in myplan note 17 (`doc_eea3BzAG1fugdaPf`, rev 8) and the
v1 build plan. Supersedes the retired protocol decisions for all v1 jobs.

## Context

The v1 design defines one `sidequest-v1` pair per network. Every listed job is a hire with a frozen
reward, terms, approver, arbitrator and settlement windows. Rewards are escrowed through `SidequestHolding`; stake
reservations and outcome recording are handled by the v1 evaluator and vault.

## Decision

### One pair, per-offer terms

- `SidequestHolding` + `SidequestEvaluator` are the v1 pair. Discovery is request → quotes → selection off-chain;
  on-chain every job is one hire.
- Each offer sets its own `reviewWindow` and `disputeWindow` (1 h–14 d) and `arbitrationWindow` (12 h–14 d), and its
  own `arbitrator` (zero = `defaultArbitrator`). All are frozen into the listing at publish and are part of the terms
  the worker activates against. The evaluator reads them through `termsOf` everywhere; it has no window of its own.
- `publish` refuses an arbitrator equal to the creator or the approver, and requires
  `expiredAt ≥ deliveryDeadline + review + dispute + arbitration + margin` so the core's own expiry can never
  pre-empt a settlement still in progress.
- `activate` refuses a worker who is the listing's creator, approver or arbitrator. The plan named the approver and
  arbitrator; the creator is added because it is the same conflict (the approver defaults to the creator anyway).
- `defaultArbitrator` is settable by the owner (the Safe, `Ownable2Step`), not immutable: it is resolved and stored per
  listing at publish, so changing it never touches a live job, and arbiter keys may need to rotate.
- The EIP-712 domains ("SidequestHolding" / "SidequestEvaluator", version "1") and the `Selection`, `Ruling` and
  `EvidenceAttestation` type strings are unchanged. `verifyingContract` separates the pairs, so the SDK's
  `typed-data.ts` signs for v1 unchanged.

### The review fixes

- **M1, ruling order.** Every terminal path in the evaluator runs: checks → record `outcome` and `slashed` → emit →
  slash the loser's bond → release the other bonds → core call → feedback. A hostile reward token that re-enters
  `SidequestHolding.settle` during the core call finds both bonds already settled, and `settle` itself consults
  `creatorPenaltyDue` and `workerPenaltyDue`, so even a re-entry before the slash would slash rather than release.
- **M2, `_payWorker`.** Accept, silence and a ruling for the worker `try core.complete{gas: CORE_GAS}` (300k). On
  failure (a refusing or gas-burning token, an expensive worker hook, a paused core), or when the core charges fees,
  the evaluator sets `payoutDeferred`, emits `PayoutDeferred`, and tries `core.reject("payout-deferred")` with whatever
  gas is spare so the net reward lands in Holding; otherwise the permissionless `retryDeferred` (or the core's
  `claimRefund` after expiry) brings it there. `earnedByWorker` is true for a deferred payout and for an `Accepted`,
  `Silence` or `RuledForWorker` outcome, so `settle` pays the worker or records the amount as `owed`. A ruling for the
  creator tries `core.reject{gas: CORE_GAS}` the same way. Before the core call the evaluator requires gas for the full
  `CORE_GAS`, the bookkeeping and the feedback (`CoreGasTooLow`), so a starved core call can never pass for a refusing
  token, and a gas-burning one consumes at most `CORE_GAS` and cannot roll the decision back (C9-001). Feedback is best
  effort. Once an outcome is recorded every other terminal path reverts (`AlreadyResolved`); the arbitration timeout
  reverts `AlreadyRuled`, so a deferred ruling for the worker can never become a refund, and `retryDeferred` only
  finishes the recorded outcome (C9-003).
- **M3.** `policyListed` is keyed by creator and hash. A copied hash published by someone else no longer blocks the
  real creator; a creator still cannot fund the same offer twice (R114-07).
- **Ruling nonces** are per arbitrator (`rulingNonceUsed[arbitrator][nonce]`), since arbitrators are now per offer and
  one arbitrator's nonce must not burn another's.

### Fees and top-ups

- `FeeSchedule` maps the worker's stake to a rate: thresholds 0 / 10k / 100k / 1M SIDE at 30 / 10 / 3 / 1 %, the
  treasury Safe as recipient. The Safe retunes it through `propose` → `execute` (anyone, after 3 days) → `cancel`. A
  proposal needs a zero first threshold, strictly ascending thresholds, rates ≤ 3000 bps that never increase, and a
  nonzero treasury. Four tiers, fixed-size arrays: a bounded loop and a simple ABI.
- At `activate`, Holding snapshots `feeBps = feeSchedule.feeBps(vault.stakeOf(worker))` (reservations included,
  cooldown excluded) and `fee = ⌈reward · feeBps / 10 000⌉`, capped at `reward − 1` so `net ≥ 1` (C9 MATH-1), and
  funds the core with `net = reward − fee` only. The
  worker's `SetBudgetAuthorization` names `net`, so its signature pins the fee it agreed to; `quoteActivation` tells it
  the number. A schedule change never touches a live job. The core's own fee stays 0: `activate` refuses a core that
  charges one, and a fee set later routes the payout through Holding, so the worker is never charged twice and nothing
  strands in the evaluator (C9 ACL-5).
- Holding keeps the fee until `settle`: to the treasury when the worker is paid, back to the creator on a refund.
  `FeeCharged(jobId, token, worker, creator, amount, bonusPart)` is emitted on a paid settlement and is the input to
  mining. The treasury is read at payout time.
- `topUp` lets anyone add a bonus in the reward token after activation, while the core job is Funded or Submitted. The
  bonus pays the worker with the reward at the same rate (`bonusFee = ⌈bonus · feeBps / 10 000⌉` to the treasury), or is
  refundable per contributor with `claimTopUpRefund` (pull-based; anyone may trigger it, the money goes to the
  contributor). The worker agreed to "at least the reward"; the bonus sits outside the signed terms.
- Every outflow (worker, treasury, creator, contributor) is a push with a fixed gas budget (`TRANSFER_GAS` = 300k,
  reading at most 32 bytes back) and falls back to `owed[token][account]`, withdrawn with `withdraw(token)` (no gas
  cap). The push runs in its own call frame (`pushPayment`, callable only by Holding), which reverts unless the transfer
  clearly succeeded, so a token that moves the balance and then returns `false` is rolled back before `owed` records it
  (C9-002). A refusing, reverting or gas-burning token never blocks bonds or other payees. The caller must leave room
  for the full frame (`TransferGasTooLow` otherwise), so starving the call cannot push an honest payee into `owed`.
  `topUp` is refused once the evaluator has recorded an outcome.
- Accepted griefing vector: anyone can `delegate` to a worker, or request/cancel an exit, just before activation
  and change its active backing tier. The worker's budget authorization then names the wrong `net` and activation
  reverts until it re-quotes. The delegator retains its position, subject to slashing and exit rules; the mismatch
  reverts without moving job funds. See ADR-0014.

### SIDE v2, the vault and mining

- `Factory`: ERC-20 + ERC20Permit + ERC20Burnable, 18 decimals. The constructor takes `(recipients[], amounts[])`,
  requires a sum of exactly 1e9 · 1e18, mints once, and has no owner: no mint, pause, blocklist or upgrade, so nobody
  can freeze stake or bonds. Allocation: mining 500M (`MiningReserve`), treasury 200M (Safe), team 150M (OZ
  `VestingWalletCliff`, parameters from config, default `start = T0 + 1 y`, duration 3 y), ecosystem 100M (Safe; the
  deployer on testnet), liquidity 50M (deployer, then the pool seed).
- `StakeVault` v2 (ADR-0014, 5 Oct) keeps per-Holding bond reservations and account-owned vetoes, with
  `Ownable2Step` and `ReentrancyGuardTransient`. Wallets retain shares when delegating behind another account;
  `stakeOf` is total active backing, including reservations, while queued shares remain slashable but no longer
  count for the tier or new bonds. `requestUndelegate(account, shares)` is allowed while bonded and restarts the
  whole queue's cooldown. `withdraw(account)` pays its owner after unlock only when remaining pool assets cover
  reservations (`StillBonded`); `cancelUndelegate(account)` restores active backing. Slashes burn SIDE pro-rata,
  including queued shares, and a full slash advances the generation and invalidates older positions. Invariants:
  per-pool `reserved <= assets`, `totalReserved <= totalAssets`, vault balance >= `totalAssets` (queue included).
  Admission/bootstrap/revocation remain unchanged; revoked Holdings still settle only their own `reservedBy`.
  See ADR-0014 for the four accepted testnet edges and the event ledger for future profit-sharing epochs.
- `MiningReserve` holds the 500M and funds the distributor for epochs that have ended, capped so the total ever funded
  stays within the cumulative schedule (epoch 0: 72 h and W · 3/7; epoch k ≥ 1: a week and `W >> ((k − 1) / 26)`,
  W = 500M / 52). Unspent budget rolls over. The α = 0.5 cap on emissions against fee value is applied off-chain.
  The schedule sums to more than the reserve: `cumulativeBudget` converges to W · 3/7 + 26 · W · (1 + 1/2 + …) =
  500M + W · 3/7, so after about seven halving eras (about 3.5 years) it promises more than the 500M the reserve holds.
  `cumulativeBudget` is therefore capped at 500M, so past that point `fund` reverts `ExceedsBudget` cleanly instead of
  failing a transfer (review C6-002). Both mining contracts take one explicit, nonzero `genesis` (the recipe's `t0`);
  there is no implicit "now", so they can never disagree on an epoch boundary (review C6-001).
- `EpochDistributor`: the Safe posts `setRoot(epoch, root, total, dataHash)` after the epoch ends, backed by funds
  already in the distributor and not promised to an earlier root. `claim` is permissionless and stakes straight into
  the vault with `delegateFor(account, account, amount)`. Leaves are OZ double-hashed `(epoch, account, amount)`. A root can be replaced only while
  nothing was claimed from it, so a wrong root is correctable and a bad one can drain at most its own funded total.
  `resizeRoot` corrects a total after claims (never below what was claimed), so a total above the leaf sum no longer
  locks mining funds (C9 MATH-5). One leaf per account and epoch; the tree builder aggregates.

### Admin

Every owner is the Safe (`Ownable2Step`; the deployer hands over at the end of the recipe and the Safe accepts; a
pending proposal is dropped when ownership changes). The Safe's powers: the fee schedule (3-day timelock, 7-day
execution window), Holding authorization on the vault (8-day timelock, 7-day acceptance window, instant revoke), mining
funding, roots and root totals, the evaluator's verifier set, and the default arbitrator for new listings. None of
these moves escrowed rewards. Only a newly authorized Holding could touch stake, after 8 days' notice, and never stake
whose account has denied it. On mainnet the Safe also holds the core's admin roles, which are broader: pause,
`emergencyWithdraw` while paused, the fee setters, the hook whitelist and the UUPS upgrade. Those can move escrow, and
an upgrade could misreport a job's state to the evaluator and so burn an honest bond; they are disclosed as such and
the README commits to no upgrade during an active agreement. A pause no longer freezes decisions or bonds (it defers
the core call), and a core fee set later never reaches a worker (C9). Before meaningful value is at stake the Safe
should move from 1-of-2 to at least 2-of-3, and the core upgrade behind a timelock (C9 ACL-8, STAKE-1).

### Gas (Monad charges the gas limit)

Floors measured by `test/sidequest/GasFloors.t.sol`: a binary search for the smallest execution gas that succeeds,
excluding the 21k intrinsic gas and calldata. `foundry.toml` sets `network = "monad"`, and a probe confirms the tests run
with Monad's opcode pricing (a cold account access costs 10,117, not 2,600), so these are Monad floors; the earlier
"EVM pricing" note was wrong. They are dominated by fixed reserves the contracts require: about 345k per payout push
(the `pushPayment` frame), and on every evaluator decision `CORE_GAS` (300k under the 63/64 rule) plus the 446k
feedback reserve. The limits below are what the SDK and the relay should send (decisions D4a); each covers the floor
plus intrinsic gas, calldata and a margin for state that is colder than in the tests.

| Call | Floor | Limit to send |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SidequestHolding.settle`, worst case (2 bond releases, worker and treasury pushes) | 619k | 1,000,000 |
| `SidequestHolding.settle` after an accept (bonus and fee pushes) | 478k | 1,000,000 |
| `SidequestHolding.claimTopUpRefund` | 367k | 450,000 |
| `SidequestHolding.cancel` (core reject, bond release, reward push) | 523k | 700,000 |
| `SidequestEvaluator.accept` / `completeAfterSilence` | 987k | 1,200,000 |
| `SidequestEvaluator.rule` (with a slash) | 1,011k | 1,200,000 |
| `SidequestEvaluator.ruleWithSignature` (with a slash) | 1,035k | 1,200,000 |
| `SidequestEvaluator.rejectAfterDeliveryDeadline` | 1,034k | 1,200,000 |
| `SidequestEvaluator.retryDeferred` | 133k | 300,000 |
| `StakeVault.reserve` | 88,474 | 200,000 |
| `StakeVault.delegate`, new pool and position | 132,602 | 300,000 |
| `StakeVault.requestUndelegate` | 70,179 | 200,000 |
| `StakeVault.withdraw` | 81,968 | 200,000 |

The vault v2 floors were measured on 5 Oct after the VV2-001 share cap, with the same binary-search harness.
These are local Monad-priced execution floors, rather than live receipt gas. Limits include intrinsic/calldata
and a margin; wallet estimation against the deployed state remains the final check.

The evaluator limits rose from 1.1M because each decision now reserves the full `CORE_GAS` before the core call
(C9-001). A gas-burning token costs a decision no more than this: the core call is capped, the second core attempt
uses only spare gas, and `retryDeferred` finishes it later. The C8 fork rehearsals run a disputed hire on Monad
testnet and mainnet forks under these limits; the live `eth_estimateGas` in B11 stays the final check.

### Deploy

`script/SidequestRecipe.sol` runs in the plan's order as separate steps (core; vesting, Factory, FeeSchedule, vault,
Holding, evaluator; wiring; `bootstrapHolding`; distributor, reserve, the 500M; handover), every parameter from the
`sidequest` config block and no predicted address: the deployer receives the mining allocation at genesis and forwards
it once the reserve exists. Staking stays closed until the bootstrap (C3-001), so nobody can force the launch onto the
8-day path. A reused core must charge zero fees, since Holding keeps the fee itself. The deploy has two steps (review
C8-001): `DeploySidequest.s.sol` broadcasts and writes only a gitignored candidate, because forge runs it before anything
is sent; `PromoteSidequest.s.sol` then proves the candidate on-chain (`SidequestVerify`: code, wiring, bootstrap, the
untouched reserve, one genesis, owners and core roles) and against forge's receipts, and only then writes `.deployment`
in the D1/D5 shape, with receipt block numbers. A dry run or a failed broadcast leaves the config untouched; promotion is
idempotent and refuses a config it cannot rewrite faithfully.

### C9 audit (2 Oct)

Method: the ethskills audit skill (`evm-audit-skills` master index and checklists). Seven specialist passes ran in
parallel over `contracts/src/sidequest/`, with the vendored core as counterpart and the deploy recipe in scope:
general; precision and math; ERC-20 with flash loans; staking; signatures with proxies; governance with access
control; assembly with DoS and chain-specific (Monad). Slither and the ethskills security pre-deploy checklist ran
too, and the Codex reviewer traced C8-001…003 and C9-001…003. Findings from several passes are merged below. Agent
severities follow the skill's definitions; reviewer findings keep the reviewer's.

| Finding (passes) | Severity | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C9-001, ERC20-1, DOS-1, GEN-4, DOS-7: a gas-burning reward token, or an expensive worker hook, made worker-side decisions revert at any limit (the 416k feedback reserve no longer fit), freezing the worker bond or letting the creator win by timeout | High | Fixed 41cb743: core calls capped at `CORE_GAS`, room for the cap, bookkeeping and feedback required up front, fallback `reject` on spare gas only, feedback best effort. DOS-1's overflow variant: `topUp` refuses a reward + bonus that would overflow (1c54e12) |
| C9-002: a token that moves the balance then returns `false` (or short data) was paid and also owed | Medium | Fixed 1c54e12: the push runs in its own only-self frame (`pushPayment`) that reverts on failure; `owed` only after the rollback |
| C9-003, GEN-1, ERC20-2, DOS-3: a pending milestone claim plus a deferred refund locked the job for good | Medium | Fixed 41cb743: permissionless `retryDeferred`, which only finishes the recorded outcome; `topUp` refuses a decided job (1c54e12) |
| ACL-2, GEN-2, DOS-5: deadlines kept running through a core pause (delivery burn, arbitration timeout) | Medium | Fixed 41cb743: a pause defers the core call instead of blocking the decision; `notePause` records the pause and a delivery deadline inside it refunds without the burn |
| C9-007: only the latest pause was remembered, so a later pause erased an unresolved job's exemption | Medium | Fixed: an append-only pause history searched by binary search, used identically by the timeout and `workerPenaltyDue` |
| ACL-1, GEN-3, STAKE-2: the 8-day Holding delay did not protect stake still bonded when a new Holding went live, nor mining rewards claimed for an account | Medium | Fixed a108863: `setHoldingDenied`, the account's veto, checked by `reserve` |
| STAKE-1: core pause froze bonds; a core upgrade could misreport job state and burn a bond | Medium | Pause: fixed 41cb743 (decisions and bonds proceed during a pause). Upgrade: an accepted Safe power, now disclosed in Admin, with the recommendation to timelock it |
| DOS-2, GEN-6: the feedback `catch` copied unbounded revert data (Monad's linear memory makes a returndata bomb cheap) | Medium | Fixed 41cb743: at most 32 bytes |
| C8-001: the deploy script wrote the config before the broadcast | Medium | Fixed 99f7c32: candidate + `PromoteSidequest` with live and receipt checks; anvil pipeline rehearsal |
| C8-002: promotion required exact balances anyone can change (dust, `burn`) | Medium | Fixed cdaad49: lower bounds; genesis supply from the Factory creation receipt |
| C8-003: promotion accepts a pending handover | Info | Kept (coordinator): `/admin` uses the promoted record for the six `acceptOwnership` calls; `owner() == safe` is a separate launch check |
| ACL-5, SIG-4, GEN-7, ERC20-6: core fee setters reached live jobs; an evaluator fee stranded in the evaluator | Low | Fixed: `activate` refuses a charging core (1c54e12); a payout under core fees goes through Holding (41cb743) |
| ACL-3: the deployer key keeps owner powers until the Safe accepts | Low | Proposals are dropped on ownership change (a108863); promotion refuses any pending proposal, funding or root (99f7c32). Residual: the Safe accepts at launch |
| ACL-4, STAKE-3: proposals never expired; revoke left a re-acceptable proposal | Low | Fixed a108863: 7-day windows; revoke and bootstrap clear proposals |
| ACL-6, SIG-3, GEN-9: the fresh core's roles went to a Safe address without checking it exists | Low | Fixed 99f7c32: `check` requires code at the Safe; promotion too |
| MATH-1: the fee rounded down, so tiny rewards in 0–2-decimal tokens paid none | Low | Fixed 1c54e12: rounds up, capped so `net ≥ 1` |
| C9-006: rounding up departs from the brief's worker-favour rounding (at most one raw unit per component) | Low | Accepted by coordinator decision D11: the fee and the bonus fee round **up** and the fee is clamped to `reward − 1`, so a fee-paying job always pays a fee and `net` is never 0 |
| MATH-5, STAKE-4, GEN-11: a root total above its leaf sum locked funds forever | Low | Fixed a108863: `resizeRoot`. Duplicate leaves per account: the tree builder aggregates |
| SIG-1, GEN-8: an older evidence attestation could replace a newer one | Low | Fixed 41cb743: `StaleEvidence` |
| SIG-2: an arbitrator could not revoke a signed ruling | Low | Fixed 41cb743: `cancelRuling` |
| GEN-5, DOS-4: a worker can suppress its ERC-8004 feedback by making the evaluator an operator of its agent | Low | Accepted: the evaluator's `outcome`/`caseOf` is the canonical record; indexers count a self-feedback `FeedbackFailed` as negative |
| ERC20-3: `withdraw` sends everything and only to the payee | Low | Accepted: redirecting a blocklisted payee's funds would invite the issuer to blocklist Holding itself |
| ERC20-4: the core-to-Holding refund leg is not measured, so a token that starts charging or rebases down draws from other listings in the same token | Low | Accepted: isolation is per token (ADR-0010); such tokens are unsupported for full value |
| ACL-8: the launch Safe is 1-of-2 | Low | Governance recommendation (Admin); the mainnet Safe is set at R2 |
| MATH-2, DOS-6: the 10k slack assumed Ethereum's cold-access price | Info | Fixed: push frame +25k (1c54e12), feedback reserve +40k (41cb743) |
| MATH-3, SIG-6, C9-005: `validUntil` truncated to 48 bits; then clamped, which left storage and event apart | Low | Fixed: an expiry above `uint48` is refused (`SafeCast`), so storage and event agree |
| MATH-4: `budget` overstated what `fund` allows past the cap | Info | Fixed a108863 |
| MATH-6, ACL-9 (config): recipe casts wrapped silently | Info | Fixed 99f7c32: `SafeCast` and bounds |
| STAKE-8, GEN-12: `stakeWithPermit` NatSpec promised relaying | Info | Fixed a108863 |
| ACL-9: replaced proposals emitted no cancel | Info | Fixed a108863. The fee treasury is read at payout, not per job, and Holdings are authorized by address (only non-upgradeable ones may be authorized); TeamVesting keeps OZ's single-step `Ownable` |
| STAKE-5, STAKE-6, STAKE-7: tier griefing via a worker's own unclaimed leaf; one stake lends its tier to many jobs; donations are unrecoverable | Info | Accepted |
| ACL-7, SIG-5, SIG-7: the default arbitrator resolves at inclusion; attestations do not name the verifier; `termsHash` is a label | Info | Accepted: clients pass an explicit arbitrator and compare `getListing` before activating; verifiers are EOAs |
| ERC20-5, GEN-10: `FeeCharged` is free in a self-minted token and is emitted even when the fee went to `owed` | Info | For the mining pipeline (B8): count only priced, allowlisted tokens and only fees the treasury received |

Slither (`slither-analyzer` via `uvx`, sidequest sources only) on the final code: `uninitialized-state` on
`_listings` is a false positive (written through a storage pointer); `incorrect-equality` is the `eta == 0` sentinel;
the `reentrancy-no-eth` and `reentrancy-events` hits are writes after calls to the trusted vault and core inside
transient `nonReentrant` frames, in the order M1 requires; `timestamp` is the windows. `uninitialized-local` (an
implicit `false`) was made explicit.

Pre-deploy checklist (ethskills security):
- Access control: every privileged function has an explicit guard, and every owner is a Safe via `Ownable2Step`.
- Pause: the only pause is the core's, held by the Safe, and it no longer freezes decisions or bonds.
- Reentrancy: every state-changing entry point is guarded.
- Token decimals: amounts are in the token's own units, with no hard-coded `1e18`.
- Oracles: none.
- Math: `mulDiv` throughout, with rounding in the protocol's favour.
- Return values: `SafeERC20` everywhere except the bounded push, which checks the result itself.
- Input validation: zero values, bounds and lengths are checked.
- Events: every state change emits one.
- Maintenance: timeouts, `retryDeferred`, `notePause` and `settle` are callable by anyone with a stake in the result.
- Approvals: exact `forceApprove` amounts. The one infinite approval is the distributor's to the immutable vault, which
  pulls only inside `claim`.
- Fee-on-transfer: refused, measured at every inflow.
- MEV: no swaps.
- Proxies: only the vendored core is a proxy; it initializes atomically, its implementation is disabled, and its
  upgrade authority is the Safe.
- EIP-712: domain, nonces and deadlines are enforced.
- Delegatecall: none.
- Testing: Slither ran, the five fuzz tests passed at 10,000 runs, and the invariant tests passed. Edge cases are
  covered: zero, max, unauthorized callers, reentrancy and hostile tokens.
- Source verification: due after deploy (the coordinator's step).

## Consequences

- Indexers and the SDK use the v1 ABIs generated from the implementations (`scripts/gen-abi.ts`:
  `sidequestHoldingAbi`, `sidequestEvaluatorAbi`, `stakeVaultAbi`, `feeScheduleAbi`, `factoryV2Abi`,
  `miningReserveAbi`, `epochDistributorAbi`).
- Bonds require stake: a creator stakes before publishing a bonded offer, a worker before activating one.
- The vault is the highest-value contract and the focus of the C9 audit.
- V1 excludes cross-chain settlement.
