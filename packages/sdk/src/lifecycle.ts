/**
 * One lifecycle model for every surface (Explore, the widget, MCP text): where a job stands, who acts next, by when,
 * and which actions the contracts accept now. It folds the indexer's words (`packages/indexer/src/fold.ts`) and the
 * board's (`packages/board/src/service.ts`, `TaskStatus`) into one set of phases, so a list row and a job page never
 * disagree. Pure: no viem, no React, no clock unless `now` is omitted.
 *
 * Deadlines follow the contracts: an action is allowed at its deadline and refused strictly after it, so a window has
 * passed only when `now > end`. Silence after a timely submission is acceptance, and every timeout is permissionless.
