/**
 * One transaction instead of several (EIP-7702): the wallet points its own code at the MetaMask
 * `EIP7702StatelessDeleGatorImpl` (the deployment's `delegation.delegator`) and calls ERC-7579 `execute` on itself
 * in batch mode, so an approve, an approve and a publish land together, all or nothing, with one signature.
 * `msg.sender` of every inner call is still the wallet, so nothing on the protocol side changes, and the DeleGator's
 * ERC-1271 accepts the wallet's own raw EIP-712 signatures. The same code is what lets a creator sign execution
 * budgets as delegations (ADR-0009), so every account here points at one delegate.
 *
 * The first batch carries a signed authorization (a type-4 transaction); later ones are ordinary calls to self while
 * the code still points at the delegate. Monad: a delegated account's transaction may not lower its balance below
 * 10 MON by more than the gas fee. Board transactions carry no value, so only gas is spent.
