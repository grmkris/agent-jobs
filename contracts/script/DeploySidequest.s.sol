/// @notice Step 1 of 2: broadcasts the Sidequest v1 recipe for one network. It never touches `config/<network>.json`:
///         forge runs this function locally *before* it broadcasts anything, so whatever it writes is only what it
///         intends to send (review C8-001). It writes that as a candidate, `broadcast/sidequest/<network>.candidate.json`
///         (gitignored), and only on a `--broadcast` run. Step 2, `PromoteSidequest`, verifies the candidate on-chain
///         and records it. Run deliberately, by the coordinator only:
///
///         NETWORK=monad-testnet forge script script/DeploySidequest.s.sol --rpc-url $MONAD_TESTNET_RPC_URL \
///           --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --slow
///
///         If the broadcast stops part way, finish it with the same command plus `--resume` (forge replays the saved
///         sequence; this function does not run again, so the candidate stays the one for that sequence). Mainnet
///         (chain 143) additionally requires MAINNET_GO=yes, set only on Kris's explicit go, and signs from a keystore,
///         never a raw key: `--account sidequest-deployer --password-file ~/.config/sidequest/deployer.password`
///         (docs/mainnet-runbook.md §2, §3.2).
