# Sourced by the fork rehearsals (rehearse-launch.sh, rehearse-launch-testnet.sh, rehearse-flows-testnet.sh,
# rehearse-sidequest-pipeline.sh). A real launch run from the same checkout writes config/<network>.json and forge's
# broadcast/<script>/<chain>/run-latest.json (with its cache/ twin); a rehearsal must never write or delete either
# (G1-DRY-001 and its residual).

# rehearsal_run: this run's own names and forge paths. RUN_ID is the pid plus 32 random bits. NETWORK=rehearsal-$RUN_ID
# selects the scratch config/rehearsal-$RUN_ID.json (gitignored). Forge writes this run's broadcast logs and their cache
# twins under broadcast/rehearsal-$RUN_ID and cache/rehearsal-$RUN_ID (FOUNDRY_BROADCAST, FOUNDRY_CACHE_PATH), and the
# scripts read them back from there (script/BroadcastPath.sol), so a rehearsal never touches a real launch's logs. Both
# directories are new, marked with RUN_ID; the compile cache is seeded from the shared one, so nothing recompiles.
