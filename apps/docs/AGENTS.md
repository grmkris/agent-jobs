# Docs app

`@sidequest/docs` is the Fumadocs/TanStack Start documentation site. From the repo root:

- `pnpm --filter @sidequest/docs dev`: author pages with the docs dev server.
- `heavy pnpm --filter @sidequest/docs build`: prerender and verify static output.
- `pnpm --filter @sidequest/docs exec tsc -p tsconfig.json`: typecheck.
- `pnpm --filter @sidequest/docs exec vitest run`: component, content, origin, address, theme, and LLM tests.

## Content contract

Pages live under `content/docs`. Frontmatter `title` and `description` are required; `mcp` defaults to `true`, and `mcp: false` hides a page from MCP. List every page explicitly in a `meta.json` (a folder may list its own pages). Use ordinary GFM tables, lists and links, fenced code with optional `title="…"`, and images under `content/docs/images/`.

| Component | Markdown form |
| --- | --- |
| `<Callout type="info\|warn\|error\|success" title?>` | `> **Title:** body` |
| `<Cards>` / `<Card title href description?>` | `- [title](absolute .md URL): description` |
| `<Steps>` / `<Step title>` | numbered bold title, then indented body |
| `<Tabs>` / `<Tab title>` | bold title and body for every tab |
| `<Origin path="/mcp" link? />` | absolute URL (compile time) |
| `<ContractAddresses />` | current deployment table (compile time) |

Components use static string attributes and direct children. Raw `a`, `img`, `table`, `pre` elements are allowed within the tested attribute contract. Keep prose data-only: no imports/exports, JSX expressions, braces, arbitrary components, inline handlers, unsafe URLs, raw contract addresses, hand-typed Sidequest origins, code-fence `tab=` or `npm` language, `(group)` folders, or frontmatter `slug`. `{{SIDEQUEST_ORIGIN}}` is allowed only inside code. Sidequest packages are private; do not document package-manager installation commands for them. This docs track allows no `legacy: true` pages. `test/content.test.ts` enforces the contract on every page.

## Build and serving

The docs source honours `SIDEQUEST_DOCS_ORIGIN`; `source.config.ts` keeps compiler plugins outside the browser bundle and disables code highlighting for `SIDEQUEST_DOCS_EXPORT=1`. `src/lib/markdown.ts` exports `pageMarkdown(page)`, shared by the `.md` route and MCP export.

The app prerenders into `dist/client`. Explore copies only docs assets, server-function cache, and LLM files into its client build; its Worker serves `/docs`, `.md` twins, search, and LLM text with content negotiation and per-response script nonces. No new infrastructure resource is created. Explore dev serves a built docs site; use the docs dev server when authoring. `SIDEQUEST_DOCS_PREBUILT=1` reuses a verified build for local Explore builds; release builds rebuild by default.

Design fallback 1 is active: TanStack Start's `prerenderWithVite`, without Nitro (its Vite 8 bundle fails on Shiki's WASM `env` import), with `autoSubfolderIndex: false`. Pages are explicit and crawling is filtered. `scripts/verify-output.mjs` validates every output and checks MCP Markdown parity when that lane's generated module exists.
